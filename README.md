## Introduction

This section outlines the research idea. We can also cite related work here [@Wickham2014; @Baumer2017].

Note that compiled term paper (the PDF) is supposed to be more text-centered than the RMarkdown documents we used in class, i.e. the text sections are more detailed and big or redundant code chunks can be hidden.

## Data

This section describes the data sources and the data gathering process.


```{r}
# A code chunk that exemplifies the data gathering process
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Additional code chunks that repeat tasks or do basic things can be hidden
```

## Results

This section presents the main results.

### Data exploration

The results section may have a data exploration part, but in general the structure here depends on the specific project.

```{r}
# What happens here depends on the specific project

### Analysis

This section presents the main results, such as (for example) stats and graphs that show relationships, model results and/or clustering, PCA, etc.
