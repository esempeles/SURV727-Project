## Introduction
Trying to write something new.
Ellena is now trying to write something new.
Third time is the charm
One more time
This section outlines the research idea. We can also cite related work here [@Wickham2014; @Baumer2017].

Note that compiled term paper (the PDF) is supposed to be more text-centered than the RMarkdown documents we used in class, i.e. the text sections are more detailed and big or redundant code chunks can be hidden.

## Data

This section describes the data sources and the data gathering process.


```{r}
# A code chunk that exemplifies the data gathering process
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Additional code chunks that repeat tasks or do basic things can be hidden
```

## Results

This section presents the main results.

### Data exploration

The results section may have a data exploration part, but in general the structure here depends on the specific project.
